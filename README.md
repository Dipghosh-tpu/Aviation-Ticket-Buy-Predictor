# Introduction to Business Problem :-
Every business has an extremely important task of understanding their customers, acquire more customers, offer better product/services for customer retention and thereby build formidable competitive advantages. Also, the customer engagement rules have changed, as most of the businesses are adopting digital channels, because the customers have become more tech savvy and more educated digitally. Aviation companies also share this same ideology of segmenting, targeting and positioning their customers. So how do the aviation understand more about their flyers? They collect data from different customer touchpoints. The data collected will help in identifying the behavioural patterns and insights in choosing the services of the Aviation company. Adding to the engagement, the customers now have option to choose to access the digital pages of the company on their devices. Here we have some of the engagement data of the customers on social media and online/digital platforms of the company, and our job is to find out how the different social media engagement parameters combined with social variables have shaped the decision of opting for a flight service, also in future given these parameters, will a flyer choose the services or not. After understanding the different parameters, the company then can build targeted advertisement for flyers for enhancing customer satisfaction and delight.
